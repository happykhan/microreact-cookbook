Go to the "Metadata blocks" and check the ST box.

Observe the new metadata column next to the tree, with the header "ST".

In the tree with added metadata blocks, we can observe a large brown block of isolates belonging to ST258. You will need to check the Legend on the very right of Microreact.

On a close look, we can observe that ST258 is associated with the presence of the carbapenamase gene KPC-3.
