This advanced tutorial has been adapted from content presented in the [Digital Epidemiology Workshop](https://cgps-group.github.io/digitalepiworkshop/hands-on/exercise.html), hosted in Colombia in September 2023. In this series of exercises, you will use Microreact to gain knowledge regarding a large collection of *Klebsiella pneumoniae* isolates, sampled from Colombia, between 2013 and 2019. At the end of this series of exercises, you will be able to identify a high risk clone circulating in the country.

## Microreact features demonstrated

* Opening a Microreact project
* Creating your own copy of a project
* Creating a new panel 
* Creating a standard stacked bar plot 
* Creating a new chart
* Customising a chart
* Updating an existing view
* Saving changes to a Microreact project

## Getting started 

!!! warning 
    You must use either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as your internet browser. 

The dataset used through these recipes is already available on Microreact. Go to [microreact.org/project/kpncolombia](http://microreact.org/project/kpncolombia) and explore the collection of isolates. We will use these data for a series of recipes:

1. Create an editable project.
1. Present whole genome sequencing quality control (WGS QC) statistics in a chart.Â 
1. Explore what are the dominating sequence types (STs) in Colombia.
1. Plot metadata blocks for the carbapenamase genes CTX-M-15, NDM-1, KPC and OXA to answer what are the prevalent AMR mechanisms detected. 
1. Explore which STs are associated with the presence of carbapenamase genes.
