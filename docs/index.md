# Welcome to The Microreact Cookbook

This 'cookbook' has a collection of examples or 'recipes' to show you how to make the most of [Microreact](https://microreact.org/). [Microreact](https://microreact.org/) is a free and online visualisation tool, primarily for genomic data but it can be used for a variety of data visualisation use cases. The typical use case is to create stunning interactive data visualisations as this example shown below.
