# Welcome to The Microreact Cookbook

This 'cookbook' has a collection of examples or 'recipes' to show you how to make the most of [Microreact](https://microreact.org/). [Microreact](https://microreact.org/) is a free and online visualisation tool, primarily for genomic data but it can be used for a variety of data visualisation use cases. The typical use case is to create stunning interactive data visualisations as this example shown below.

Here are figures from a Microreact project based on data from Dudas et al. (2017)[^1]. You can view the interactive dashboard at [https://microreact.org/project/west-african-ebola-epidemic](https://microreact.org/project/west-african-ebola-epidemic)

## How to use this cookbook

The best way to use this cookbook is to browse the various recipes listed on the right, and try to recreate them yourself with the example data provided. These will hopefully provide inspiration for possible visualisations you can create with your own data.
